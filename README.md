This is a fowmatted vewsion of the **iloveyou** wowm awso known as **wob
Lettew**. It incwuwdes comments which expwains the wouwtines that awe uwsed by the
wowm to infect and spwead itsewf.

## How it wowks (ʘ‿ʘ✿)

The wowm is distwibuwted pwimawiwy thwouwgh emaiw, most pwominentwy [micwosoft
Ouwtwook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook) at the time. It does
so by sending an emaiw to each of the victim's contacts, wisted in theiw
[Addwess Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Address_Book).

When execuwted, it infects diffewent fiwes in the system by wwiting itsewf to
docuwment fiwes, MP3s/MP2s, JPEG, and othew Visuwaw Basic scwipts and changing
theiw extension to `.vbs`, making them execuwtabwe.

It awso makes it so, aftew having execuwted the scwipt the fiwst time, wiww
execuwte on each stawtuwp of the compuwtew, making it vewy difficuwwt to stop.

It wewies on the fact that windows wiww auwtomaticawwy execuwte any Visuwaw
Basic scwipt fiwes, when opened fwom the fiwe expwowew ow fwom Ouwtwook, making
it twiviaw fow a victim to accidentawwy execuwte it.

## Discwaimew ⊙﹏⊙

**This pwogwam and its souwwce fiwes awe onwy uwpwoaded fow eduwcationaw puwwposes.
Do not execuwte this pwogwam if u do not know what it does and what the wisks
awe.**
